      Wow! Here it is! The first website link and chunk of content that I put together locally on my laptop via Terminal, Sublime and Git now LIVE on the Interwebs after pushing my code up to GitHub. I can hardly believe that these are words coming out of my mouth! I was always surrounded by developer communities but had shyed away from diving into code myself because "well, I'm more of a business person, you see." Bullshit. In retrospect, I know that the real reason I tiptoed around actually learning to code myself was that this space intimidated me. My first exposure to development was among hacker whiz-kids at top startups in Silicon Valley and at hackathons I helped organize all over the map. While I have huge respect and admiration for developers, I had previously doubted my ability to ever hone in on such skills. After several years of toying with the idea, I am happy to share that I've taken the first step to becoming a developer with Dev Bootcamp.

        I'm in my first week of Phase 0 and I have to say, once you put that fear aside, it's not too bad. So far, so good! I look forward to deepening my learning in the upcoming weeks and months. As part of our first week's assignments, DBC encourages us to blog our experience and learnings, which puts us students in a vulnerable position but also an exciting one. I hope that years down the line when I'm able to whip up a website or an app in a jiffy, I look back at this post and feel proud to see how far I've come. (Hello future self! I hope you are wonderful!)

        This week I've learned the basics of how to navigate through Terminal, I've come to understand Git and GitHub, and I've come to learn the brilliance that is version control. I wish we were able to have version control in many other aspects of life besides code! Version control allows you to save your progress as you go and should you want to change tracks or should you make a mistake for some reason, you can always go back to a former version. Git is awesome as it allows you to keep track of changes easily within your Terminal. After just a few days, I can confidently push up code to GitHub without having to review my notes! Please excuse my enthusiasm here - these little baby-steps are just getting me all the more amp'd at what I can go on to build in the future.

    <p> When I lived in San Francisco, I went to GitHub's sweet HQ in SOMA and I feel foolish for not fully understanding at the time what an amazing company's office I was dancing around in (but acutally though -- I was there for a tech party #SiliconValleyProblems). GitHub is a website that can host Git repositories and because it's on the internet, your code and its several versions can be widely accessible. GitHub is a particularly excellent tool for collaborating on projects. Developers that may be located all over the world can work on the same project and they can track one another's progress, make comments on people's commits to help make sure everything is on track. I look forward to being more active on GitHub and open source communities moving forward.
