  <h2>The DBC Experience</h2>
  <h4>January 18th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I am entering this Phase 0 period with Dev Bootcamp from a different lens than most students. I actually work at DBC NY as our employer partnerships manager. Prior to DBC, I worked at a company called AngelHack where my role was to help organize and secure sponsorships for our global hackathons (coding competitions). While I've always been surrounded by developer communities, I've never taken on the task to learn myself until now, thanks to DBC's underlying culture, support and the sheer inspiration this community provides.
    </p>
    <p>
        DevBootcamp's culture is unlike anything I've ever experienced. Besides teaching the concepts and skill-sets needed to be a strong developer, DBC also focuses on helping people become better citizens all around. When working on development teams, you are always being met with roadblocks: you have a problem and you are set to solve it, your code randomly breaks, there's a bug that's needs fixing ASAP, etc. In short, developers are contstantly solving problems which is fun, sure, but is also stressful. DBC puts a focus on mind and body wellness as a developer too, besides just teaching the curriculum at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      DBC is an extremely accepting and inspiring community. We even have a Holocracy dircle dedicated to diversity in the technology space. Day in, day out, I am surrounded by people who are pushing themselves to extremes to learn a skill set that at one point probably felt unachievable. I see beginners transform into full-stack developers and I am so lucky that it is my JOB to help pair these sharp candidates to development opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>The environment and community that Dev Bootcamp fosters is ideal for learning and I look forward to my journey of understanding this side of the student experience. It doesn't hurt that I'll be learning some development skills along the way too. Let's go forth and build beautiful and meaningful things!
